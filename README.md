# Payroll-REST-API

## About
- We’re going to create a simple payroll service that manages the employees of a company.
- We’ll store employee objects in a (H2 in-memory) database, and access them (via something called JPA).
- Then we’ll wrap that with something that will allow access over the internet (called the Spring MVC layer).
